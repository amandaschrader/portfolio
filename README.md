Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.
What is a polished, portfolio-quality state?
When a project is both polished and in a portfolio-quality state, this means:

You've reviewed your project and your README prior to submitting it to make sure there are no errors or missing information and you are consistent in your indentation, spacing, and code structure.
You are following the best practices and coding conventions we teach.
What are the baseline project requirements?
All independent coding projects at Epicodus have these baseline requirements:

A complete and informative README
The project's commit history demonstrates that the project’s required work schedule and hours have been met:
8 hours completed on Friday is required for full-time students
4 hours completed over the weekend is required for part-time students
Completion of the project based on the prompt and objectives. The prompt contains details on the project's theme and features that are not always detailed in the objective. Carefully read through the prompt towards the end of your work session to make sure that you are not missing anything.
Further Exploration
If you finish the objectives with time to spare, consider adding additional features such as:

Using bootstrap to style your elements.
Explore and incorporate animations with CSS.
Look through this list of HTML elements and incorporate one or more into your project.
Look through this list of Markdown elements and incorporate one or more into your README.
