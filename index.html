    <h1>Amanda Schrader's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Portfolio! A little about me... I love reading, gardening, andlearning how to code. My favorite season is summer and favorite holiday is the Fourth of July. I love spending time with my family and friends.</p>
    <p>I have a Bachelors in Accounting, and currently I'm working as an Accountant at an Aerospace company here in the Portland area. I've always been interesting in Computer Science, and recently took a class on Python at OSU. From there, my interest has grown and decided to take the more extensive Epicodus program.</p>
