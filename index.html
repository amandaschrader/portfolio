        >Welcome to my Portfolio! A little about me... I love reading,
        gardening, and learning how to code :). My favorite season is summer and
        favorite holiday is the Fourth of July. I love spending time with my
        family and friends, preferably chatting/laughing around a fire during
        summer.</em

        >I have a Bachelors in Accounting, and currently I'm working as an
        Accountant at an Aerospace company here in the Portland area. I've
        always been interested in Computer Science, and recently took a class on
        Python at OSU. From there, my interest has grown and decided to take the
        more extensive Epicodus program.</em
